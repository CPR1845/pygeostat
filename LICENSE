Last Revised August 30, 2016                                                      %

The Centre for Computational Geostatistics (CCG) at the University of Alberta     %
has evolved over the years, yet the basic idea remains the same: organizations    %
provide research funding for access to research results. CCG software is          %
intellectual property of CCG; the following principles apply to the use and       %
support of CCG software.                                                          %
                                                                                  %
 1. Openness within the CCG Community                                             %
    All researchers within CCG share all software developed at the CCG openly     %
    within the CCG community. All software aims for high standards, but many      %
    programs are works in progress.                                               %
                                                                                  %
 2. Support of CCG Software                                                       %
    There is no support provided for CCG software. CCG researchers may address    %
    questions and reports of errors and deficiencies. CCG Research Partners       %
    receive greater consideration.                                                %
                                                                                  %
 3. Software Use for Short Courses and the Citation Program in Applied            %
    Geostatistics Course participants use CCG software for exercises and          %
    projects, but should not use the software for commercial application outside  %
    of the CCG community after the training course.                               %
                                                                                  %
 4. Use in Commercial Software                                                    %
    A CCG member may embed CCG software within commercial software that they      %
    develop or apply, if they take responsibility for the product.                %
                                                                                  %
 5. Software Use if a CCG Member Drops Support                                    %
    It is an expectation of the CCG community that former CCG members discontinue %
    the use of CCG software embedded within their practices and applications,     %
    unless they were the developer.                                               %
                                                                                  %
 6. Software Use by the Developer                                                 %
    A particular researcher within CCG can distribute their software as they see  %
    fit. Special care is required for derivative works built on previous CCG      %
    software.                                                                     %
                                                                                  %
 7. Released Software                                                             %
